## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `yarn`, start a development server:

```fish
yarn db:push

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
yarn dev
```

## Building

To create a production version of the app:

```fish
yarn db:push
yarn build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

To run the app on Node.JS run `npm build`.
